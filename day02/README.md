### Day 2
Not easy going. Did get reps in with the debugger so that's something at least. Missed a bunch of edge cases that I had to catch the hard way. Also looks like I overcomplicated it... many in the forms are just doing it brute force. Have to remember computers are fast.

TAKE 2: Came back to try part 2 again. Only hold up was misunderstanding substring, I was expecting it to behave like a slice, didn't realize the second parameter was length. After figuring that out, this simple approach for part 2 was easier than my original approach for part 1. Learned me lesson - did it the easy way for day 3 and it worked great. I'd like to come back later and see if my over complicated approach for part 1 actually sped it up at all or if the overhead actually slowed it down.
