### Day 1 
Easy going. Worked with ChatGPT to get a scaffold I was happy with based on my requirements. Refreshed on C++ I/O, forgot about sstream, it's pretty neat! Especially compared to the Go file parsing from the last AoC I did. 
I didn't consider how landing on 0 would affect the hits for part 2 when turning left. Caught with the sample test and debugged with print statements. Planning on getting comfortable with the debugger again tomorrow.
